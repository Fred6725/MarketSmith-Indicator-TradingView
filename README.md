# MarketSmith-Indicator-TradingView
Hello everyone,

Everything is now available directly on TradingView!
https://www.tradingview.com/u/Fred6724/#published-scripts

I have made these scripts available for you to replicate visually and functionally MarketSmith graphs on a free subscription plan on TradingView.

To import them, just copy the entire code text and go on your TradingView graph.
Clique on 'Pine Editor' at the bottom left, then select 'Open' -> 'Indicator' and paste the code here. You can save it and find it on "My scripts".

If you appreciate my 200+ hours work for you and want to support me to bring you more features like this (eg: pattern recognition), feel free to buy me a coffee, it will be much appreciated :)
